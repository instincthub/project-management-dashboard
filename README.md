# Project Management Dashboard 

A data dashboard is an information management tool that visually tracks, analyses and displays key performance indicators (KPI), metrics and key data points to monitor the health of a business, department or specific process. They are customisable to meet the particular needs of a department and company. Behind the scenes, a dashboard connects to your files, attachments, services and APIâ€™s, but on the surface displays all this data in the form of tables, line charts, bar charts and gauges. A data dashboard is the most efficient way to track multiple data sources because it provides a central location for businesses to monitor and analyse performance. Real-time monitoring reduces the hours of exploring and a long line of communication that previously challenged companies.

This lesson shows how to create a reusable and customisable dashboard with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ChartJs.
